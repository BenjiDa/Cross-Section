Cross Section toolbox for ArcGIS 10.1

Evan Thoms, USGS

A toolbox of python-based geoprocessing tools for performing a variety of tasks associated with (primarily, but not limited) geologic cross-sections:

-convert lines of cross-section over a DEM to surface profiles
-convert a line of cross-section over a DEM and a geologic polygon layer to a surface profile of contiguous line segments attributed the same as the polygon layer
-convert borehole location points and an optional table of borehole interval descriptions to sticklogs
-convert structural measurement points to cross-section points attributed with the apparent dip

Download the zip file, extract to a suitable location, and add to ArcMap through the ArcToolbox window.
